      <h2>Let's imagine this is a Sanity studio</h2>
      <p>Cause basically, a Sanity studio is just like any other single-page application. Serve <code>index.html</code> instead of the requested URL. Unless it's a file.</p>

      <p>This <code>index.html</code> was served from <code id="urlPath"></code>, for instance.</p>

      <p>Alright, that's all there really is to it. Enjoy!</p>
